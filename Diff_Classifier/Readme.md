  * Unzip the sample to your machine 
  * Double click on the .sln file to launch the solution 



**Run the sample**

  1. To run the sample, hit **F5** or choose the **Debug &gt; Start Debugging** menu command. A new experimental instance of Visual Studio will launch. 
  2. Once loaded, open a file that has the _.diff_ or _.patch_ filename extension. 
  3. Observe text coloring on lines that are prefixed with the defined sumbols: **---**, **+++**, **-**, **+**, **&lt;**,**&gt;** and **@@**.

**Project Files**

**AssemblyInfo.cs**

This file contains assembly custom attributes.

**DiffClassificationDefinitions.cs**

This file contains the definitions for the various classifications, as well as
the coloring to apply to each classification type.

**DiffClassifier.cs**

This file defines the class that searches a given span of text to locate and
evaluate identifiers.

**DiffClassifierProvider.cs**

This file implements the provider to classify .diff and .patch files

**Test.diff / Test.patch**

Test files used to verify that the classifier is working properly. The text in
these files will display in color



**Functional Tests**

  * Verify the sample builds in all configurations
  * Verify that the sample was registered. The About box should list the product as installed
  * Verify that files with the .diff or .patch file extension display colored text as defined in _DiffClassificationDefinitions.cs_
