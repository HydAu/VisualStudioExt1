When building an IronPython WPF Application, you may receive the following error message: 

	Unknown build error, 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object'. 

In order for XAML compilation to succeed, a valid CodeDomProvider is required to be registered on the machine for the language being compiled. 
Because this is a global machine configuration setting, the IronPython sample does not attempt to register the IronPython CodeDomProvider automatically. 
In order to register the IronPython CodeDomProvider manually and build IronPython/WPF projects with Visual Studio or MSBuild, you can do the following:
 
	Open %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\CONFIG\machine.config in a text editor (such as Notepad)

	Add the following to register the IronPython CodeDomProvider as a direct child of the root <configuration> node: 

	<system.codedom>
	  <compilers>
		<compiler language="py;IronPython" extension=".py" type="IronPython.CodeDom.PythonProvider, IronPython, Version=1.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=4afbdc4d950a9602" />
	  </compilers>
	</system.codedom> 

	Close & Save machine.config
