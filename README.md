# Visual Studio Extensibility Samples
These samples demonstrate how to customize the Visual Studio editor using the 
[Visual Studio SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166441.aspx). You 
can use editor extensions to customize the appearance and behavior of Visual 
Studio. The following are some of the ways in which you can extend Visual Studio: 

* Add commands, buttons, menus, and other UI elements to the IDE
* Add tool windows for new functionality
* Add support in Visual Studio for new programming languages
* Add refactoring or language analyzers to fix and improve code
* Add a custom project type or new project or item templates
* Reach millions of developers via the Visual Studio Gallery

* In addition to these samples, many completed extensions have been published to 
GitHub or other repositories. Here's a [list of other community Visual Studio 
extensions](http://microsoft.github.io/extendvs/).
* You can publish your completed extension to the 
[Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.com), where you can also get
more information about joining the [Visual Studio Partner Program](https://vsipprogram.com/).  

Thanks for your support for Visual Studio - we're excited to see what extensions
*you* build!
