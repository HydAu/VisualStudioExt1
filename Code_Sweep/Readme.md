# Title: Reference Package Sample
**Abstract:** Sweep a solution looking for any words that match search terms
in an XML Schema. Display any matches on the Task List.[ View this sample online](https://github.com/Microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples).

* Technologies: Visual Studio 2015 SDK
* Topics: MSBuild, VSX
* Last Updated: 05/20/2015

**Description**

This sample allows the user to specify a set of terms to search for by
specifying a set of XML files containing the term definitions. The user-
configurable settings are stored in the project file. The scan can be invoked
either on command or as an integrated part of the build process. When the scan
is performed, a custom task provider causes hits, if any, to be shown in the
task list.

  * Demonstrates writing MSBuild tasks, which run as part of the build 
  * Uses .NET remoting to communicate information from an MSBuild task back to the host IDE 
  * Store and retrieve information in both MSBuild and non-MSBuild projects 
  * Implements a custom task provider, including a custom toolbar and shortcut menu 
  * Place commands in the Project menu and Solution Explorer shortcut menu, and handle them 
  * Includes an algorithm to search for multiple terms across multiple streams of characters 



**Requirements**

[ Visual Studio 2015 ](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-
us/try/default.mspx#download)

[ Visual Studio 2015 SDK ](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads
/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs.aspx)



**Build the sample**

  * Download the zip file associated with the sample 
  * Unzip the sample to your machine 
  * Double click on the .sln file to launch the solution 



**Run the sample**

  1. To run the sample, hit **F5** or choose the **Debug &gt; Start Debugging** menu command. A new experimental instance of Visual Studio will launch. 
  2. Once loaded, open an existing project or create a new one. 
  3. Right-click on the project in the **Solution Explorer** window . 
  4. Click the **CodeSweep** button. A dialog box should appear. 
  5. In the dialog box, click **Add** to add files containing additional search terms to the sweep. 
  6. Click **Scan Now** to scan the project. 
  7. View scan results in the **Task List** window. 



**Details**

This sample is divided into four projects:

  1. **Scanner**: class library that implements the scanning functionality 
  2. **BuildTask**: MSBuild task implementation that allows the scan to run as part of the build process 
  3. **VsPackage**: Visual Studio Package (VSPackage) implementation that provides a UI for the scanning functionality 
  4. **Utilities**: generally useful utility functions used by other projects in the solution 



Define search terms for the code sweep in XML files. See
_VsPackage\sample_term_table.xml _for an example of the supported format. Each
term may have zero or more **exclusions**, contexts in which the term will not
be counted as a hit. The list of term tables to use is specified on a per-
project basis, and can be configured in the dialog box invoked by the
_CodeSweep_ command. (available in the **Project** menu or **Solution
Explorer** shortcut menu)

Only files with supported extensions can be scanned; others are ignored. This
restriction exists so that large binary files can be avoided if desired. The
list of supported extensions is found in _extensions.xml_. Add new extensions
here to support them. Extensions.xml is copied to the user's _Application
Data\Microsoft\CodeSweep_ folder on first run.

The user can explicitly invoke a scan at any time, or configure MSBuild to run
a scan at any time. Use the configuration dialog box in either case. If the
scan is enabled to run during build, it will be run in command-line builds as
well as builds in the IDE.

Scan results are sent to the Task List. To see them, click _CodeSweep _in the
provider drop-down list on the **Task List** toolbar. Double-click a result in
the list to go to its location.

The CodeSweep Task List toolbar contains four buttons:

  1. **Stop Scan**: 
  2. **Repeat Last Scan**: 
  3. **Ignore**: Mark the selected result(s) as ignored, they will no longer be shown in the task list. (Including future scans) 
  4. **Show Ignored Instances**: Add ignored instances back to task list
